    "Our debutant London dry gin is a perfect combination of 9 different plants and spices. The spotlight in taste is on Juniper berries from the Tara mountain and the root of Angelica, followed by Lavender flowers, lemon and orange skin aromas.  The harmonious combination of other spices emphasizes the sensation of freshness and raises the balance of flavors to a higher level. Smooth body of gin is a product of exhaustive distillation that also preserves the essential oils, being the key to the uniqueness of the taste of this classic. Apart from being the perfect base for numerous cocktails such as the famous Martini and Gin fizz, many prefer to drink it 'pure' with a slice of lime or mixed with tonic. Cheers!" : "Our debutant London dry gin is a perfect combination of 9 different plants and spices.

    " If you love espresso and enjoy gin just as much, then this is a double treat for you. 2Tales in cooperation with Java Coffee has prepared a phenomenal union of these two drinks in the form of the Coffee Gin. Infusion of the high quality coffee grains from Columbia and Ethiopia with a hint of vanilla, standing in a perfect balance with juniper and floral-citrus curtain. Pleasant sweetness and creamy body of this drink will enchant you. We recommend that you consume this classy drink with ice or mixed with tonic, but you also shouldn’t miss the Coffee Negroni nor Espresso Martini. Cheers!

    "A challenge that goes a long way from a corn-based alcohol to a perfectly balanced drink favoured by many. As many as 7 distillations and lying in activated charcoal between each of them is the secret of getting an ultimately pure drink. Subtle grain sweetness, smooth body and texture followed by divine freshness give originality to this handcraft.  We recommend that you always cool it well.": "A challenge that goes a long way from a corn-based alcohol to a perfectly balanced drink favoured by many.
